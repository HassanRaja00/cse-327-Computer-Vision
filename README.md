## HW1
Implement different Gaussian filters and apply convolutions to images to see effects of smoothing. Implemented Canny edge detector and histogram equalization.

## HW2
SIFT features detecting keypoints in images. Simple image classification with support vector machines (SVMs)

## HW3
Mathematical theory of perspective projection, and camera calibration. Used SIFT features to stitch images together
